I find it interesting how companies that hold such valuable information dont have the latest and up-to-date cyber security systems. this database holds information like credit card limits and other sensitive information. this database was unlocked for an unknown amount of time and the company didn't find out until they were made aware of it when a person called Fowler emailed them about it and then the database shut down. it is crazy how the company themselves didn't know what was happening someone else had to make them aware fo their mistake.
